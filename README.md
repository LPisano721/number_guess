# number_guess

This program features the IF, ELIF, and ELSE commands to demonstrate a simple guessing game. This program also features a counter sytem. I used use breezypythongui.py to assist with creating a GUI.

# Note:
Both the files, paneldemo.py and breezypythongui.py, must be in the same working directory
